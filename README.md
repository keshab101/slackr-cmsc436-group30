## App Description:

It used to be easy to find study groups, just go to class and talk with your neighbors. However, itâ€™s kind of hard to do now that classes are online. This is a group matching app that lets users create a profile and match with other users who share their same study habits or the lack thereof. This app can help students at universities create and find study groups. Our main objective is to assist students in finding study groups that match their study interests. They have the options to search by groups or create their own groups. Within each groups, students can create a thread of posts where they can add posts and communicate with other members of the group.
